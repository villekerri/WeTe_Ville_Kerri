    <h1>1980's Home Computers</h1>
    <p>In early 1980's, home computers became mainstream. For the first time, computers could be
        purchased by an average family household.</p>

    <h2>Clever uses</h2>
    <p>Some reasons often mentioned were:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>learning to write computer programs</li>
        <li>managing family finances</li>
        <li>keeping track of freezer contents</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The main usage for a home computer was, of course, games. As cool games may not be a valid reason
        for purchasing an expensive gadget, a wide variety of potential uses were invented to satisfy those
        family members who might otherwise be sceptical.</p>

    <h2>Legendary computers</h2>
    <p>The best known computer of the eighties was <a href="commodore64.html">Commodore 64</a>, but there are other computers that gained popularity.</p>

    <h2>Key concepts</h2>
    <p>The hardware charateristics of a home computer could be defined by its graphics and sound capabilities, CPU, and amount of memory.</p>
    <p>There are two types of memory:</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>RAM</dt>
        <dd><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">Random access memory</a>. The memory usable by programs. The amount was typically
            in the ballpark of 20 to 64 kilobytes. However, the Basic interpreter by default
            consumed a part of this.</dd>

        <dt>ROM</dt>
        <dd><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory">Read-only memory</a>. This was normally smaller in size than RAM and roughly
            corresponded to the hardware implementation of the operating system.</dd>
